 - **Years of Experience by Salary**: Employees' years of experience were categorised into three groups (Less than 5, Between 5 and 10 and More than 10). It was analysed by salary and employee ID. This helped to identify the relationship between years of experience and salary, as well as the number of employees under each group.
